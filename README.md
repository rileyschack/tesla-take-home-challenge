# Tesla Take Home Challenge

This is an open-ended exercise intended to demonstrate your ability to find, collect, and analyze a publicly available dataset utilizing skills and tools that will be critical for your success in this role. We ask you to complete this exercise within 48 hours, but don't expect you to spend more than a few hours on it. Be prepared to explain your thought process, the results, and what you would improve upon this process if you might apply a similar method to analyze millions of vehicles.

Using NASA's publicly available API on Near Earth Object (NEO) history, create a simple Python script that will ingest the previous year's history into a new Cloud Splunk instance using HEC. Create a dashboard with multiple visualization based on the ingested data. Please submit your Python code, the XML of the dashboard, and a screenshot of your finished visualization. Create and share the credentials to a new read-only account with access to the dashboard and indexed data within your Splunk Cloud instance to share your work.
